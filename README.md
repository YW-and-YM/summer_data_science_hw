# Summer Data Science Homework

## Lab 1

In this lab homework, you will practice writing Python code to analyze student scores. You will implement functions to calculate the average, maximum, minimum, number of scores above a threshold, median, and standard deviation of a list of student scores.

You will also practice reading data from a CSV file in Python.

## Lecture 2

In lecture 2, we learned the concept of p-value and went through a simple demo about tossing coins. We also learned how to use Monte Carlo simulations to get a numerical approximation of a PDF (Probability Density Function). In the homework, you will explore more cases in the tossing coin example - for example, what if the probability of getting a head is not 0.5, but other numbers?
