# Summer Data Science Homework

## Lab 1

In this lab homework, you will practice writing Python code to analyze student scores. You will implement functions to calculate the average, maximum, minimum, and number of scores above a threshold, median, and standard deviation of a list of student scores.

You will also practice reading data from a CSV file in Python.

## Lecture 2

In lecture 2, we learned the concept of p-value and went through a simple demo about tossing coins. We also learned how to use Monte Carlo simulations to get a numerical approximation of a PDF (Probability Density Function). In the homework, you will explore more cases in the tossing coin example - for example, what if the probability of getting a head is not 0.5, but other numbers?

## Lecture 3

Lecture 3 covers the basic operations with Numpy and Matplotlib. We used the [salary dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmahdiabbootalebi/salary-by-job-title-and-country?resource=download) to show how to make histograms and scatter plots and use some fundamental functions in NumPy to do quick data analysis (mean, median, etc.). In the homework you will learn more advanced functions in NumPy, and make more plots using the salary dataset.
