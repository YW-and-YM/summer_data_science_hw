# Lecture 3: NumPy and Matplotlib Basics
## Demo
- Read csv data with PandaS
- Basic calculations with NumPy: Mean, Median, etc.
- Generate uniform array with NumPy: `np.arange` and `np.linspace`
- 1D Histogram in Matplotlib
- Scatter/Plot in Matplotlib
## Homework
### Learn Yourself
#### 1.1: `np.sort`
What does `np.sort` do, and how do you use it? Please sort the following list (or you can set whatever for your demo):

[3,6,27,2,6,78]

You can consult any AI or search online for relevant information.

Questions to answer:
- What inputs are required for `np.sort`? (Hint: Try a list, a numpy array, and a single number to see which of them could work)
- What is the sequence of the output? Descending or Ascending? 
#### 1.2: `np.unique`
What does `np.unique` do, and how do you use it? Try putting `data["Job Title"]` and `data["Country"]` into this function and see the results.

### More Plots 
In the lecture, we showed the demo plots for age and salary. Now you can try making more plots for other columns of the dataset:
- Plot the histogram of `Years of Experience`. Choose a proper binning so that the histogram looks (roughly) smooth
- Do you think Salary relates to Years of Experience? Make a scatter plot to support your hypothesis.
